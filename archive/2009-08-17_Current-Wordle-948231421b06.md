[Clint Lalonde](http://clintlalonde.net/ "Clint Lalonde") recently [wrote](http://clintlalonde.net/2009/08/16/wordle-as-a-blog-self-assesment-tool/) about using [Wordle](http://wordle.net/ "Wordle") as a reflective tool in order to decide whether the blog posts that he wrote for class were on topic. I like that idea a lot. It also reminded me of thoughts that opened09 had circling in my head. Over time, a writer’s skill and focus changes, that is a given. But how to monitor this? I think Wordle provides a visual representation that is simple and powerful. I will try and take wordle snapshots of this blog every few months and compare them, mostly out of interest, but also as a way of reflecting on my own constantly changing passions and motivations.

So here it is, 17 August 2009, the Wordle for all my content is:
