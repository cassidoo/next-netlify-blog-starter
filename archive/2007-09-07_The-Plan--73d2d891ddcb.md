Ok, so first day of class is done. I’ve seen all of my professors, had a bit of a hint of how class is going to work and taken some time to figure out how I am going to manage it all.

So here goes, my grand master plan for tackling all of my courses:

#### [Microsoft Office OneNote:](http://www.microsoft.com/office/)

To organize everything and take notes. Its ability to keep information fluid, yet organized should be invaluable for all of my classes.

#### Mind Mapping:

I’ve toyed with using online mind mapping applications, but [FreeMind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/) is the best package that I can get for free. Plus the ability to copy and paste from OneNote will make connecting the things that I take notes on a breeze. I know there are varied results on the effectiveness of mindmaps… but lets give them a whirl and see where I get. This should at least be essential for Statistics where many of the things that you do is looking at the same problem in a different way and figuring out how those ways fit together is incredibly important.

#### Podcasting:

I’m going to record one of my Computer Science Lectures to test podcasting lectures. I’m still not convinces that re-listening to a lecture is the best way to spend your study time (a lot is said in a typical lecture that really doesn’t need to be memorized). I’m also thinking of recording myself reading my notes so that I have short 10 minute snippets to listen to whilst walking from A to B on this huge campus.

#### Time Management:

As I said in the previous post, I’m going with [Google calendar](http://calendar.google.com), using the layers for my timetable, due dates for assignments, Residence Advising in and out nights etc.

#### Flashcards:

For all those times when there is a long list of things and they just need to be drilled into my head. I’m going to go with [Quizlet](http://quizlet.com/), it’s collaborative and super easy to use. The added feature of creating neat little tests is a nice bonus.

#### Collaborative Projects:

[Zoho Wikis](http://wiki.zoho.com/) and documents (very soon Zoho docs will work on and offline… pure awesomeness!) For Programming Projects I’m thinking of using [Gliffy](http://www.gliffy.com), just because of their ability to do UML diagrams.

Well that’s a start, we will see how these work for keeping my schoolwork together for the next few weeks. If they don’t work… I try something else.

Cheers,  
Andre
