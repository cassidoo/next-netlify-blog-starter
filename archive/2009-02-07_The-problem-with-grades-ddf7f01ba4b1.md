Yesterday I followed a link from [D’Arcy Norman](http://www.darcynorman.net "D'Arcy Norman") to [this article](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090206.wprof06/BNStory/National/home "Story on fired Professor") in the [Globe and Mail](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/ "The Globe and Mail") about a professor who was fired because he gave all of his students A+ grades so that they could focus on the learning instead of worrying about grades. While reading the very humorous comments I stumbled across a [reference](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090206.wprof06/CommentStory/National/home#comment3130133 "Comment about Calvin and Hobbes") to this Calvin and Hobbes comic:
