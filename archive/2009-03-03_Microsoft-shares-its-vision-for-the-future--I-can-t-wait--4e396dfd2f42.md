Here is a concept video that [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com "Microsoft") recently showed at a conference. I found the original [here](http://www.istartedsomething.com/20090228/microsoft-office-labs-vision-2019-video/) (take a look at the comments, it’s pretty interesting).

Although, with all the recent layoffs at Microsoft maybe 2019 might be a stretch.

Maybe it’s time to start backing [Aubrey de Grey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey "Aubrey de Grey") on his quest to help us all live to be 1ooo years old just so that we can all live the the cool future that is sure to come…
