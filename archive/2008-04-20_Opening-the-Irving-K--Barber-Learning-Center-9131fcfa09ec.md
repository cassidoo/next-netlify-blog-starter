A few weeks ago, I was asked by Julie Mitchel if I would be able to speak at the opening of the Irving K. Barber Learning Center. She wanted me to give a studentâ€™s perspective of what the Learning Center means to the students of UBC. I accepted, not really understanding what I was getting myself into. As the weeks went by subsequent meetings with Julie made me see that the ceremony was a lot more important than I ever could have imagined. For a great description of what the ceremony was actually about, [Phillip Jeffrey](http://www.fadetoplay.com/ "Philip's blog") wrote an excellent post [here](http://www.fadetoplay.com/2008/04/14/irving-k-barber-learning-centre-grand-opening-the-future-of-learning/ "Philip's post"). I am still unable to express just how terrifying it was to speak after people like Professor [Stephen Toope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Toope) and [Gordon Campbell.](http://www.gordoncampbell.ca/) It went off pretty well though and I think my speech was well received. Pictures of the event (courtesy of Philip Jeffrey) can be found [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tyfn/sets/72157604490947312). A video of it can also be found [here](http://www.ikebarberlearningcentre.ubc.ca/webcasts/IKBLC%20Opening%20Webcast.wmv) (I talk right at the end).

It was an amazing experience and I feel so honored to have been a part of it.
