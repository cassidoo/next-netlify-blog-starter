So after Looking at [Mackenzie](http://blog.students.ubc.ca/mackenzie) and Ciara’s Facebook profiles I saw that they both look much better than most people’s. The reason being that instead of having comma denominated lists like “Interests: running, swimming, hiking, hockey…” they put them in an actual list form like so:

Interests:

Running

Swimming

Hiking

Hockey

Ciara even adds breaks using dashes. I did the same and now my profile is no longer a jumbled mess… yay!

In fact it looks so good I’ll just include it on my [about](http://andremalan.net/about/) page on this site.
