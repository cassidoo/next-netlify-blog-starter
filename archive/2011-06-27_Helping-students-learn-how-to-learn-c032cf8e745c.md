I am currently working for UBC Student Development / UBC Library as the Student Development Coordinator for the Chapman Learning Commons. My role includes managing the space, the students who work in the space and the learning services that are run out of the space.

What makes this position fascinating for me is the problem that it poses, namely: how do I manage/create/frame services in a way that actually leads to them helping students be better at school?

This problem is massively difficult, as at a university level, being better at school requires students to break over 12 years of bad habits and replace them with good habits. As anybody who has tried to pick up good habits knows (especially in the time-constrained university environment), changing habits is very, very hard work that takes time to show results. Anything that one creates to help students do this has to be really, really good (if it is possible at all).

So, for this summer, in order to actually achieve this goal I’ve settled on 4 different principles that will hopefully lead to success.

1.  **Hire good students.** This piece is critical. Having awesome students work on these projects helps keep things in perspective, makes customer development easier and brings a fresh sense of energy and ideas into the field. This piece’s current status is definitely “mission accomplished”.
2.  **1-on-1 peer mentorship is currently the only really feasible solution to this problem.** Having a well-trained peer guide you and keep you accountable is a hundred times better than any online resource or workshop that I could create.
3.  **Solve the pain.** Students experience a lot of pain and the whole point of this is to help reduce that. Wording like “learning services” means absolutely nothing to most students, we need to frame things in a way that shows them how we will help them get rid of their pain.
4.  **Be lean and agile.** Concepts like “Do More Faster”, “release early, release often” and all the other techniques that I have learnt around successful software development and entrepreneurship apply in this context too. We are here to actually fix the problem, not just follow through on the requirements document.

That’s the plan, 2 months in I hope it’s working. One of the pieces that we’ve made some big strides on is the [Learning Commons](http://learningcommons.ubc.ca) website. If you’d like to see some of the principles in action compare the [current site](http://learningcommons.ubc.ca "Learning Commons") to my student’s [current prototype](http://learningcommons-redesign.sites.olt.ubc.ca/ "prototype") (principle #1 can be seen in the quality of the work). We still have lots of work left to do on it, but the idea should be clear. If you do take a look, please drop some feedback, they are iterating fast so any feedback helps!
