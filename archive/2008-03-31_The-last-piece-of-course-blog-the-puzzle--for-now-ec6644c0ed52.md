So it’s 4:30 in the morning and I am nowhere near ready to go to bed. So instead I did the final quality testing for my “[add user widget](http://andremalan.net/2008/03/add-user-widget/)” WordPress Mu plugin.

This plugin eliminates the question that I’ve been asked plenty of times “what if a student who is not in the class adds themselves to a course blog?”. I think the answer is simple (and I think [Jim](http://bavatuesdays.com) and [Brian](http://weblgos.elearning.ubc.ca/brian/) would agree with me)… just delete and/or ban the user. However, in order to eliminate this barrier on implementing course blogs I modified the plugin to allow professors to enter a list of student emails. If the student’s email is in the list they can then add themselves to the list. This means that in conjunction with my Add to BDP RSS widget that Professors or institutions can decide whether anyone can add themselves, subscribers to the [WordPress Mu](http://wpmudev.org) system or only users that are in a specific list. This will now work for [all three](http://andremalan.net/2008/02/three-flavors-of-course-blogs-very-yummy/) of the course blog types that I created.
