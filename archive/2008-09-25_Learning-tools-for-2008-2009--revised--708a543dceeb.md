So [my last post](http://andremalan.net/2008/09/my-learning-tools/ "My learning tools") was a bit premature. Here are some of the revisons to the plan:

1) [OneNote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_OneNote "OneNote") has failed me. It worked so well in my previous classes, but I am finding it useless at the moment. Why? Well the lectures are carried out differently. In my previous classes the PDFs required a lot of diagrams and annotations… OneNote handled that perfectly. However, at the moment all the PDFs that I get are pretty self-contained, the only thing I need to do is summarize and organize the material in them.

2) So in order to replace OneNote, I am using [FreeMind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page "FreeMind") again. I think the reason that I didn’t enjoy FreeMind when I used it last year was that I didn’t have a system for icons and decoration. Now that I have a system (and another mindmap to remind me what my system is)! I am really enjoying taking notes on FreeMind. Below are some pictures of the start of my maps:

Here is my “cheatsheet” map telling what all the icons mean (as I come accross a new type of content I just choose and icon and add it to this sheet so that don’t forget the mapping).

3)I’m probably not going to use the map on my wall, just due to the fact that I have the FreeMInd maps now. I might start printing them though and stick them up!

Fickle… I know. But hey, in order to succeed we need to try new things!
