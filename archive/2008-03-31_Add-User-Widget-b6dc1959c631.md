This plugin is a modification of [sidebar add user](http://andremalan.net/wp-admin/This%20plugin%20is%20a%20modification%20of%20sidebar%20add%20user%20%20widget%20by%20DSader) widget by DSader. It adds a whole bunch of control functionality that allows admin to change who is allowed to add themselves to a blog and also what type of permission is allowed. It also changes the way that the widget appears depending on the user’s status. It was developed primarily for course blogs.

**Final, final update:**

WordPress. org has started to show OLT some love and we are now rapidly publishing all of our plugins there. The new direct link to download sidebar add user widget is [here](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/add-users-sidebar-widget.zip "download add user widget") and the plugin page is [here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/add-users-sidebar-widget/ "add user widget page").

**Final Update:**

Now that OLT has a place to house its plugins I will no longer be maintaining add user widget on this site. Instead it will live on [blogs.ubc.ca](http://blogs.ubc.ca). The direct link is [here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/add-users-sidebar-widget/ "add user widget page").

#### Update: V1.2.4

Fixed the problem with the plugin not reloading user’s status when they first add themselves.

#### Update: V1.2

Changed the way restricting users works. Now the admin can simply set a password in the widget control menu and users who know the password can add themselves to the blog.
