Here is my first WordPress plugin. It is meant to extend the excellent [BDP-RSS](http://www.ozpolitics.info/blog/?p=87) plugin by [Bryan Palmer](http://www.ozpolitics.info/blog/). This plugin allows users who are logged in to a WordPress MU system to add feeds to the BDP-RSS feed aggregator from the sidebar. It is primarily designed to allow students to add the feed of their own blog to a class aggregate blog.

Please let me know what you think.

Installation:

Just download, unzip, then drop the plugin into your plugins->BDPRSS folder and activate in the plugins menu.

Update: For some reason the control is not saving the options properly. I’ll fix it on Saturday morning.

#### Update: Version 1.2 released.

Changed the way that permissions work.

*   Simplified things by only allowing registers users of the community to add their feeds.
*   Gave admin the option of password protecting a blog so that only users who know the password can add feeds

#### [Download V1.2](http://www.andremalan.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/widget_addbdprss.zip)

As always, let me know what you think of the changed.

#### Update: Version 1.1 released.

*   Fixed subtitle bug
*   Added control over what type of user can add feeds.
*   Global: Anyone can add a feed
*   System: Anyone on the Mu System can add a feed.
*   Blog: Only a subscriber to the specific blog that the widget is on can add a feed.
*   Made it so that if a user cannot add a feed, they don’t even see the text box.
