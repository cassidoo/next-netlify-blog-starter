On the surface, watching this video is incredibly inspirational:

\[vimeo 27933991 w=400 h=225\]

[How Bad Do You Want It](http://vimeo.com/27933991) from [Greyskale Multimedia LLC](http://vimeo.com/greyskalegsk) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

However, as I watched it, there was a rush of conflicting thoughts and feelings. One part of me was saying, yes he is right, Andre, you need to be better. Work harder, cut out more distractions, become great. The other part was asking, is that really the way? Will I accomplish my goals in life through single-minded perseverance, or is it in the moments of relaxation, in the serendipitous conversations and in allowing the heart and mind to wonder to where it wants to go that will get me there?

Or, is it simply the right balance of both?
