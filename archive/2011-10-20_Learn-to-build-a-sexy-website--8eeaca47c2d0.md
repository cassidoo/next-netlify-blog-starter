I am going to be co-teaching a course soon, titled “[Learn to build a sexy website](http://www.matygo.com/courses/572-learn-to-build-a-sexy-website "Learn to build a sexy website")” with [Andrei Pop](http://andreipop.com/ "Andrei Pop"). It’s going to be offered online, on Matygo and it’s going to be kick-ass.

**So why am I teaching a course despite the hecticness of my** [**imminent**](http://redroverhq.com/2011/10/andres-h1b-visa-gets-approved/ "Visa approval") **move to** [**New York**](http://andremalan.net/blog/2011/09/17/goodbye-vancouver-hello-new-york/ "Goodbye Vancouver, Hello New York")**?**

*   [Matygo](https://www.matygo.com/ "Matygo") is an awesome company run by awesome people. I think that their model is definitely going to be step in the right direction for education and I want to be a part of that.
*   Programming is not a mystical force, it’s just a skill that can be learnt and the world will be better off if more people understood it.
*   I’m tired of making websites for people who are smart enough to make them for themselves :P.
*   I spend so much time mouthing off about better ways of teaching and learning that it really is time I put my money where my mouth is and do some teaching myself.

**The next question I guess is what is this going to look like?**

The course will run for 6 weeks. It will be taught in Matygo, which has some elements of an LMS (without many of the downsides). It will be limited to 9 participants, as the live, interactive parts will happen on Google Hangouts.

Hangouts will happen at 7:30 to 9:00 PM on Tuesday evenings starting on October 27th.

> **After the 6 weeks, if you complete all the course material that you will be able to build a great website in WordPress and have a deeper understand of how the internet works and be able to write and hack basic programs.**

So if you want to learn to code (and hang out with me online over the next 6 weeks) go check out the [course page](http://www.matygo.com/courses/572-learn-to-build-a-sexy-website "Learn to build a sexy website")!
