I just finished presenting a workshop on Personal Learning Environments to around 300 international students for UBC’s [JumpStart international orientation](http://ubcjumpstart.com). I think it went really well, but for anybody reading this that went to the lecture, don’t hesitate to comment below on how I could improve.

My story arc was as follows:

In order to create and effective personal learning environment you need to recursively go through the following process:

*   **Personal:** First figure out who/where you want to be (in 5–10 years time) using a visioning exercise, then try and see who you are now and note the differences.
*   **Learning:** In order to get from where you are now to where you want to be, you will have to learn things (skills, knowledge etc), note down what those things are.
*   **Environment:** Learning is a product of your environment. You can adapt your environment to learn better, without adding effort. Identify ways you can change the environment around you.
*   **Habits:** The best way to change your environment is to create good and destroy bad habits. Only way to do this effectively is one at a time and with 30 day trials.

After following that process several times you can slowly start to permanently change your environment in a way that allows you to learn.

**Below is the presentation as well as a list of resources and technology tools that can be used to augment your PLE:**
