So I’ve now had a week of classes. It feels great to be learning again after 8 months of solid work. Since I last [wrote a similar post to this](http://andremalan.net/2007/09/the-plan/ "The Plan") I have a gained a much better perspective on all the tools out there and know what works for me and what doesn’t. So, here goes my big bad list of learning tools for university:

#### Microsoft Office OneNote:

I cannot find any note-taking software that comes even close to [OneNote’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_OneNote "OneNote") ability to keep notes for school. The three levels of navigation and ease of printing PDFs straight to OneNote (seeing as almost all professors insist on delivering their notes in PDF and note HTML) puts OneNote ahead of everything else. I would desperately like to use [EverNote](http://www.evernote.com/ "EverNote") (because I can use it from more places than my personal computers with OneNote installed), but it doesn’t let me scribble all over course PDFs like OneNote does.

#### Mind Mapping:

Last year I tried out [FreeMind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page "FreeMind") as a means of organizing notes after they were taken. It was great software and worked pretty well, but I just didn’t enjoy using it. I think that the limits of current screen sizes is what makes virtual mind maps so difficult. I just felt like I could never see the full picture and the detail at the same time (which, I believe is something mind maps should let you do). So instead I went lo-tech and have taped a giant white piece of paper to my wall that I will use to map and connect all of my courses on. It is a new experiment, let’s see if it works! I might also resort to using FreeMind again especially for the guest lecturers that are going to be coming in to my Software Engineering Course as there won’t be any predefined lecture notes that I can annotate in OneNote.

To-do lists:

I tried [Remember the Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com "Remember The Milk") a few months ago and for some reason it just didn’t stick. I revisited it about three weeks ago and now find it invaluable. The big change I think is that you can embed your to-do lists **everywhere!** I have my list in my [gMail](http://gmail.com "Gmail"), my i[Google](http://google.com "Google"), my [Google Calendar](http://www.crunchbase.com/product/google-calendar "Google Calendar") my iPhone and on my desktop. I can send tasks to it using Jott. I find that if my to-do lists are not in my face I forget to look at them. With Remember the Milk I can have a constant reminder.

Remember the milk lets you categorize items, add recurring items (a great one is “pay bills”) and lets you know when things are overdue. Remembering to hand in an assignment, or study for a midterm will be a whole lot easier with Remember the Milk.

#### Flashcards:

Most courses require some degree of memorization. [Quizlet](http://quizlet.com/ "Quizlet") is so much better than any other online flashcard app that I have tried. It gained me plenty of marks last year and everyone that I know who uses Quizlet swears by it. It is easy and fun to use. It is collaborative. It has tests. It will soon have an iPhone app. Enough said.

#### Time Management:

[Google Calendar](www.google.com/calendar "Google Calendar") is possibly the greatest tool ever. My life would be incomplete without it. I actually have over 15 calendars in there that I use to organize my life and keep track of the people around me.

#### Collaborative Projects:

I’m already using [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/apps/ "Google Apps") for my work on the [Student Leadership Conference](http://slc.ubc.ca "Student Leadership Conference"), so I will probably use that (if my team agrees that is) in my Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interfacing projects. I’m still looking for a good collaborative way to do UML diagrams, seeing as how expensive [Gliffy](http://www.gliffy.com "gliffy") has become.

#### Pen and Paper:

For my Math courses I’m going the old fashioned notebook route. I really don’t see any other way (seeing as I don’t have a [tablet PC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_PC "Tablet PC")). Hopefully the big mind map will compliment it nicely though and maybe help to make some connections between the three Math courses that I am taking.

I will monitor the effectiveness of all of these tools and update depending on what works and what doesn’t (or if I find something around the internet that blows one of these out of the water).
