[Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) and I have a love-hate relationship. I love Wordpress for the fact that to do simple things, it is incredible simple to use. I hate it for the fact that to do less simple things it baulks. It screams “SSH into the server and play with my core php files biutch!”.

I guess I should provide some background on why WordPress and I have any relationship at all. At the moment I am developing a blogging platform for UBC to replace [weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca.](http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca) This project will hopefully allow bloggers at UBC to connect with each other and inspire the creation of some rich academic and personal content. We are trying to do this all with WordPress.

At this year’s [Northern Voice Conference](http://2008.northernvoice.ca/) [Jim Groom](http://bavatuesdays.com/) (a true expert on WordPress who’s blog and [creation](http://umwblogs.org) have helped me solve so many problems with my own blogs) is thinking of hosting a [WordPress anonymous](http://bavatuesdays.com/wordpress-anonymous/) session that welcomes all Wordpress lovers as well as “haterz”. I am neither, but I have started dreaming about WordPress so I guess I should really attend.

I do have one big complaint about WordPress that I need to get off of my chest now (and will probably continue to rant about at NorthernVoice):

I’m bitterly upset over the fact that WordPress trusts nobody! Without heavy plugins and hacking you just can’t do anything fun… no matter who you are. Admin has no ability to upload theme files and page templates. I know that security is an issue (especially in WPMU) but I just wish there was a simple way for an admin to say: “Ok, WordPress… I trust this user and his blog, why don’t you go ahead and let him use a tiny little embed tag…?”I know that there are probably plugins or hacks to do that… but they are not easy to find. Assigning “superuser” roles that don’t strip you of any advanced coding or limit you to pre-installed themes and templates would be such a great addition to wordpress… and would probably convert many of the “haterz” out there. I mean think about it… with that kind of functionality… who needs Movable Type?
