I don’t know about you, but I am terrible at organizing my email. I didn’t realize that “archiving” was something that somebody should do with email until I had thousands of unarchived emails and decided to come up with a different way of doing things. This is what I do:

I treat unread email as to do items. When I check my email I respond to the things I have time to respond to and the rest I mark as unread so that I can respond to them later. This is a very hassle free system. Except, there is one big problem. [Gmail](http://gmail.com "Gmail") does not have a default “show all unread mail” button. This means that it is hard for me to compare my unread mail (to do items) and prioritize this means that some big tasks end up being buried under pages and pages of emails. Of course, with Gmail’s new addons this is very easy to do. Here is how:

1.  Go to “settings” then “labs” on the top right menu bar.
2.  Scroll down and enable the quick links addon.
3.  \[caption id=”attachment\_323" align=”alignnone” width=”542" caption=”enable the add links in settings”\]
4.  \[/caption\]
5.  in the search box type in the following: in:inbox in:unread. Click search mail
6.  \[caption id=”attachment\_324" align=”alignnone” width=”408" caption=”search box”\]
7.  \[/caption\]
8.  In the quick links box (middle left of your screen) click “add quick link”.
9.  \[caption id=”attachment\_322" align=”alignnone” width=”189" caption=”add quick link”\]
10.  \[/caption\]

And there we have it, now your Gmail is set up to list all of your unread mail without the interference of stuff that you have already dealt with.
