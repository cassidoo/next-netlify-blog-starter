As I said in my previous post… I’m not doing school anymore. I am on Coop, which means that I get to work full time and still be a student. It’s a pretty sweet deal. I’m working at the UBC [Office of Learning Technology](http://olt.ubc.ca) and it is a great place to be.

My current project is recreating weblogs@ubc. It’s going to be based on Wordpress, with a lot of cool features, including CWL login. Soon I will also be working on UBC wikis so look out for posts about this in the future. I might even need some help from some UBC students in order to get some of the community based initiatives off of the ground.
