I don’t understand how there can even be any validity to the “heuristic multi-touch” [patent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent "Patent") that [Apple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc.") was just granted. Why? Here are the facts as I see it:

1.  In order to obtain a patent you need to prove that you are the original inventor. To quote [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patentable_subject_matter#United_States):
2.  Section 101 of Title 35 [U.S.C.](/wiki/United_States_Code "United States Code") sets out the subject matter that can be patented:

*   _Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title._

1.  This means that someone has to prove that they are the person who invented the technology. So for instance someone delivering a presentation on that technology to thousands of people means that there is no way that someone else can apply for the patent afterward.
2.  The Apple patent states the following:

*   A computer-implemented method for use in conjunction with a computing device with a touch screen display comprises: detecting one or more finger contacts with the touch screen display, applying one or more heuristics to the one or more finger contacts to determine a command for the device, and processing the command. The one or more heuristics comprise: a [heuristic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic "Heuristic") for determining that the one or more finger contacts correspond to a one-dimensional vertical screen scrolling command, a heuristic for determining that the one or more finger contacts correspond to a two-dimensional screen translation command, and a heuristic for determining that the one or more finger contacts correspond to a command to transition from displaying a respective item in a set of items to displaying a next item in the set of items.

1.  The Apple patent was filed on April 11th 2008
2.  [Jeff Han](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Han "Jefferson Han") gave this presentation (in front of thousands) at the [TED Conference](http://ted.com) in February 2006:  
    [http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf](http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf)
3.  Jeff Han’s presentation clearly shows all the things listed in Apple’s patent and was produced before the patent application. Therefore the patent is clearly invalid.
4.  Patents have to be non-obvious.
5.  Multi-touch heuristics are obvious. Here is a list posted by [Craig Musselman](http://www.nightmareinshiningarmour.com/) on [this post](http://news.worldofapple.com/archives/2009/01/26/apple-awarded-multi-touch-patent/). As you can see multi-touch heuristics are very obvious and have been for a long time (well at least to Hollywood anyway):

Am I wrong? This seems to be so patently obvious to me. Have I missed something? If I am not wrong, then I hope that [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com), [Palm](http://www.palm.com/us/) and even maybe Jeff’s lawyers are able to prove this and get the patent taken away.

Watching Jeff’s video about a year ago was a turning point in my life. It opened my eyes to the world of possibility that research into [human-computer interaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-computer_interaction) can provide. My life’s goal is now to be a part of that, to be someone who helps to discovers new and intuitive ways to interact with computers. It is such a shame to see his inventions stolen by Apple. I agree that patents are necessary, but really only for non-obvious things and only when you really, truly invented something yourself. Advances in any field are hampered if people and corporations do not play fair and I really feel that Apple is playing this one really dirty.
