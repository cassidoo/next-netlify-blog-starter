This term I took [Computer Science 444](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~cs444/index.html) — “Advanced Methods for Human-Computer Interaction”. The main outcome of the course was to go through the process of designing a user interface and evaluating it using formal experiments, producing a paper at the end.

I had the pleasure of working with 4 absolutely fantastic team-mates, [Piam Kiarostami](http://ca.linkedin.com/pub/piam-kiarostami/4/22b/350 "Piam Kiarostami"), [Gabe Silk](http://gabrielsilk.wordpress.com/ "Gabe Silk"), [alexandru Totolici](http://alexandrutotolici.com/), and [Jre Sarenac](http://jrejre.net "Jre Sarenac"). Each of us intuitively picked a role and we worked like a well-oiled machine.

The project we worked on was a collaborative, tabletop, multi-touch diagramming tool that we dubbed “collabee”. We compared our interface to the more traditional ways of diagramming collaboratively (whiteboard and computer) then analysed our results. Below are the reports that we wrote, as well as a video on the project that we produced (it’s only 4 minutes and be sure to stick around for the surprise ending).
