“What education will look like in 10 years” is the title of the talk that I gave at the [UBC Terry Talks conference](http://terry.ubc.ca/terrytalks "Terry Talks") a few months ago. Terry Talks is a conference modeled after the famous [TED talks](http://ted.com) and it was a raging success. In my talk I touched on the different ways in which I believe education is going to change. I spoke about how it is going to become more collaborative, more “real” and more open. I gave examples of places where all of these changes are starting to manifest themselves and drew some predictions of where things are going to go.

They don’t show my last slide, but in it is a big shout out to a few people like [Brian Lamb](http://blogs.ubc.ca/brian/ "Brian Lamb"), [Jon Beasley-Murray](http://posthegemony.blogspot.com/ "Jon Beasly-Murray"), [Jim Groom](http://bavatuesdays.com/ "Jim Groom"), [Scott Leslie](http://www.edtechpost.ca/wordpress/ "Scott Leslie"), [Gardner Campbell](http://gardnercampbell.net/blog1/ "Gardner Campbell"), [Alan Levine](http://cogdogblog.com/ "Alan Levine") and [D’Arcy Norman](http://www.darcynorman.net/ "D'Arcy Norman"), all of who’s presentations, tweets, blog posts, comments and plain old conversations have helped to shape so many of my ideas and beliefs. I think that this stuff really matters and it was your collective influences that helped me to see that.
