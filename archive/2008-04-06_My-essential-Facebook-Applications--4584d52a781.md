[FriendFeed](http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2795223269&b&ref=pd): Allows me to publish my life stream on my Facebook profile

[Boost:](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3120) Boost is a Firefox add on that allows you to change the look and feel of Facebook. Adds a bunch of cool functionality like “download whole album” and showing full size images when you mouse over them.

[Nexus](http://nexus.ludios.net/): Creates a graph of your network. Really interesting to see how you are connected to other people and how connected they are to your friends.

[FBcal](http://www.fbcal.com/): Generates an iCal file of your upcoming Facebook events and/or upcoming birthdays. Seeing as my Google Calendar plans my life, I don’t know how I’ve lived without this application for so long!
