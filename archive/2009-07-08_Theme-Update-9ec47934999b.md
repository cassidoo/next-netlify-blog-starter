FINALLY. Wow, that took me way to long to get done. So, as I promised in this [post here,](http://andremalan.net/2009/02/under-construction/) after many late nights, I have implemented some major changes to the theme of this blog. So for all those behind the feed readers… leave the reader for a bit and click around. Let me know what you think. I spent a lot of time on various elements (including some that I ripped out due to lack of patience) so any feedback would be awesome. Below is a picture of the old home page for comparison (click to see fullscreen):

Some features to note are:

*   Snazzy JavaScript slider. Why? Lets me show pictures without taking up too much space. One of my goals for this year is to learn to actually draw well in [Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/ "Adobe Illustrator") and as is obvious, I have a long way to go and need a place/reason to practice.
*   Proper [archives](http://andremalan.net/archive) page using the awesome [wp\_archives](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-archives/) plugin. I can’t think of a better way to browse archives (aside from tags maybe). The default [WordPress](http://wordpress.org "WordPress") way of dates is stupid… they just have no context. One way in which I might change this page in future is modify the plugin so that I can annotate dates around important events in my life.
*   Social Networks page. This has snippets from other places around the web that I haunt. I’m considering changing it in the future to be a bit of a life-stream, but am holding out for someone to come up with an exceptional plugin to make that happen.
*   Better fonts.
*   More pictures!

Again, let me know what you think in the comments below, any feedback is always welcome.
