So as some people have noticed lately my blog’s theme has changed. This is simply due to the fact that since last summer when I coded the old theme I have learned a lot about [usability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability "Usability"), [accessibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility "Accessibility") and just general good practices on the web. As such I couldn’t stand the old theme any longer (due to its violation of those practices) and had to change.

While the new theme does still break a whole bunch of rules when it comes to accessibility and usability, I will be fixing those as soon as I can. The theme is chosen for its style and how I identify with it more than anything else. One of the key fixes is going to be a nice (really complex to code) [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript") navigation. However, due to the fact that school is in crunch mode and due to my impending trip to [Mexico](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=19.05,-99.3666666667&spn=10.0,10.0&q=19.05,-99.3666666667%20%28Mexico%29&t=h "Mexico"), I will not be able to fix things up as early as I would like.

So there it is, new theme with many changes and improvements still to come. Comments, suggestions and all that jazz are welcome (especially as I am still on the fence about some of my ideas).
