At this yearâ€™s EmberConf on the 25th of March I gave a presentation with [Heyjin](http://heyjinjs.us/ "Heyjin Kim") highlighting some examples of times where using [Ember](http://emberjs.com/ "Ember JS") has made our jobs seem infinitely easier.

[EmberConf](http://emberconf.com/ "EmberConf") was an amazing experience, the Ember community is full of genuine and welcoming people and I am so excited to see the great things that this community will build together.
